# Employee-Template-Engine
CLI Node that takes employee info and dynimically generates a webpage

## Description
The Employee Template Engine is a Command Line Interface tools that allow users to generate an employee roster from the command line given that they are asked a series of team member questions at the command line.  The answers to those questions will populate the browser application.

## New Technology
The Employee Template Engine required that I work with new technology such as Node.js, JSON packages, NPM to include a host of devependencies such as requirer. I also utilized Jest to run test scripts to ensure that my code past all of the tests.  

## Challenges and Successes
Learing to work with classes, NPM Packages, and running test scripts using JEST were a few of my successes.  Challenges included confusion about how to run while loops and swith. That is where I stalled with respect to this project.  Once that happened, frustration built and I became confused.

## Ice Box
Future Development include continuing to work on the JavaScript so that I will be succesful at deploying fully functional CLI program
